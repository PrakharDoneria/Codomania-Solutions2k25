3. Tiling Problem  
   Given a floor of size "2 * n" and tiles of size "2 * 1", count the number of ways to tile the given floor using the 2 * 1 tiles.

4. Binomial Coefficient (nCr)  
   Write a program to calculate the binomial coefficient \( nCr \) using the formula:  
   \[
   nCr = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
   \]

5. Print Subarrays
